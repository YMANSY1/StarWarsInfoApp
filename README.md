# Star Wars Info Application

This project is a personal project of mine where I practiced key Android and Mobile App Development skills. It is a app that sends a GET request to the SWAPI and gets information about several Star Wars Characters in that API

## Things I Learned

- API Integration
- Dark Mode Integration
- View Binding
- Recycler Views
- Coroutines

## Description

In this project, I focused on integrating various Android development skills to create a functional and interactive mobile application. The main features include:

- **API Integration**: Fetching and displaying data from the Star Wars API.
- **Coroutines**: Use of coroutines to handle any activities requiring fetching of data or parsing to increase app efficiency
- **Dark Mode Integration**: Implementing dark mode to enhance user experience.
- **View Binding**: Using view binding to simplify UI interactions.
- **Recycler Views**: Displaying lists of data efficiently using RecyclerViews.

## Learning Outcomes

This project helped me gain hands-on experience with:

- Making network requests and handling JSON data.
- Managing UI state with coroutines and lifecycle-aware components.
- Implementing Recycler Views for smooth and responsive UI
- Handling different screen configurations and themes.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YMANSY1/StarWarsInfoApp.git
    ```
2. Open the project in Android Studio.
3. Build and run the project on an emulator or physical device.


## Future Improvements

- Implement the searchbar as it is currently still not functional
- Implement a settings tab to allow user to switch to dark mode in app 
- Polish the UI especially after clicking on the character names
